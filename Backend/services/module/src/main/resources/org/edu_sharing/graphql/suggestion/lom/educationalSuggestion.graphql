    #Principal user(s) for which this learning

    #
    #NOTE 1: A learner works with a learning object
    #in order to learn something. An author creates or
    #publishes a learning object. A manager manages
    #the delivery of this learning object, e.g., a
    #university or college. The document for a manager
    #is typically a curriculum.
    #
    #NOTE 2: In order to describe the intended end
    #user role through the skills the user is intended to
    #master, or the tasks he or she is intended to be
    #able to accomplish, the category 9:Classification
    #can be used.

    #Age of the typical intended user.
    #This data element shall refer to
    #developmental age, if that would be different
    #from chronological age.
    #
    #NOTE 1: The age of the learner is important for
    #finding learning objects, especially for school age
    #learners and their teachers.
    #
    #When applicable, the string should be
    #formatted as minimum age-maximum age or
    #minimum age-. (NOTE: This is a compromise
    #between adding three component elements
    #(minimum age, maximum age, and description)
    #and having just a free text field.)

    #NOTE 2: Alternative schemes for what this data
    #element tries to cover (such as various reading age
    #or reading level schemes, IQ's or developmental
    #age measures) should be represented through the

    #Predominant mode of learning supported by
    #this learning object.
    #
    #"Active" learning (e.g., learning by doing) is
    #supported by content that directly induces
    #productive action by the learner. An active
    #learning object prompts the learner for
    #semantically meaningful input or for some
    #other kind of productive action or decision,
    #not necessarily performed within the learning
    #object's framework. Active documents
    #include simulations, questionnaires, and
    #exercises.
    #
    #"Expositive" learning (e.g., passive learning)
    #occurs when the learner's job mainly consists
    #of absorbing the content exposed to him
    #(generally through text, images or sound). An
    #expositive learning object displays
    #information but does not prompt the learner
    #for any semantically meaningful input.
    #Expositive documents include essays, video
    #clips, all kinds of graphical material, and
    #hypertext documents.
    #
    #When a learning object blends the active and
    #expositive interactivity types, then its
    #interactivity type is "mixed".
    #
    #NOTE:Activating links to navigate in hypertext
    #documents is not considered to be a productive
    #action.
